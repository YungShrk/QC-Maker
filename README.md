# QC-Maker
Creates a .txt file pertaining to the number of episodes and seasons, as well as title

To use:

Download an IDE (I used VSCode, very easy to set up), as well as Python.

Donwload my .py file I added here

Once you have the python file open in VSCode, change the C:\\\Users\\\wyatt\\\OneDrive\\\Documents\\\QC Work\\\ to the folder of your choice
(if you go to it in your file explorer you can copy and paste it, make sure there are double \\\ though!)

Then hit the run button in the top right (triange) and enter the inputs it asks at the bottom: show (s) or features (f), if show, number of seasons and number of episodes. If features, number of features. For features, it will then have you type/paste them in one by one until you reach the number you said for number of features.

It will then create a .txt file in your folder, fully ready for QC work. Yes, this only saves like 4 minutes of your time but it adds up!
